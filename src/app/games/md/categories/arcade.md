Arcade games are an amazing time filler and entertainer, especially the 2 player ones, but what makes an arcade game?

## What makes an arcade game?

What makes an arcade game, you may ask. Well, there's a lot of factors needed to determine what is an arcade game and
what's not.

Although there are many things that are needed to make a game an **arcade** game, it can be simplified.

One factor that an arcade game needs to be authentic is it's **retro style**; Retro Style makes a big
difference in arcade games, when an arcade game is retro styled with low quality 64-8bit textures, it creates a
very arcade-like environment.

Along with that, arcade games are often formed in a way where players die quickly, and replay the game a lot, this makes the feeling
that the player is playing an old style arcade cabinet.

That's a small bit of what makes an arcade game, but are the two largest factors, either way, these games are amazing.
