## What makes a puzzle game?

To class a game as an authentic **puzzle game**, it should have a couple of key features, this includes:

**Perplexity:** Making the player feel perplexed creates an intruiging game where the player must **think** logically to beat it, proving that there is a
"puzzle" in the game.
**Problem Solving:** A puzzle game should have some sort of problem that the player must solve, it activates and trains the brains logic!

**Progressive Difficulty:** Most good puzzle games have difficulty that progesses higher as the player goes on, based on each level, the puzzles may become harder!

**Clear Objectives:** While the answers may not be clear, in a puzzle game, the player should know what their objective really is, without it, how are they supposed to beat the game?
